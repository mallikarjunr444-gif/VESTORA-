# Per-website garment filters

**Relevant commits:** this change is uncommitted at time of writing. The UGG policy was ported from the standalone demo repo `anywear-ugg-demo`: `7e01344` (vendored baseline, `feat/vlm-prefilter @ 112d6fe`) · `69f9228` (UGG merchant gate).
**Relevant files:** `per_website_garment_filter.js` (the bridge) · `revolve.js` · `ugg.js` · `guess.js` · `_garmentFilterRejects` / `_isTryOnableImage` / `findTryOnableProductImage` / `sendReferenceImage` / `_isProductPageCached` in `widget-core.js` · `scripts/check.mjs` §11, §12, §13, §13b, §14

## The problem

Some retailers sell far more than a torso try-on can render. On those sites the generic "is this a product image?" rules in `_isTryOnableImage()` are not enough — a jeans tile on Revolve and a boot tile on UGG are both, correctly, product images. Something has to know the retailer's catalogue.

That knowledge is per-retailer, high-churn, and worthless everywhere else, so it lives in one file per site and never in `widget-core.js`.

---

## Architecture

```
widget-core.js  ──►  per_website_garment_filter.js  ──►  revolve.js  (DecartRevolve)
                          (DecartGarmentFilter)      ├─►  ugg.js      (DecartUgg)
                                                     └─►  guess.js    (DecartGuess)
```

`widget-core.js` names no retailer. One function — `_garmentFilterRejects()` — is its entire surface, and `per_website_garment_filter.js` is the only file that names an individual retailer's global.

### Why a bridge rather than direct calls

Each site filter costs widget-core three call sites: the button predicate, the PDP image resolver, and delivery. Each needs its own `typeof` guard, because these files are absent on any store without a filter. One retailer made that tolerable. It grows at three guards per retailer, and a forgotten guard is not a crash — it is Try-On buttons silently reappearing on merchandise the model cannot render.

`check.mjs` §11 fails the build if widget-core references `DecartRevolve`, `DecartUgg` or `DecartGuess` directly.

### The adapter contract

Required:

| Member | Returns | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `applies()` | boolean | true on that retailer's hosts only |
| `isSupportedGarment(ctx)` | boolean | true = show Try-On. `ctx` is `{ imageUrl, imgEl, pageUrl, isProductPage }`; the first three may be null |

`isProductPage` is the **widget's own** product-page verdict, computed by `widget-core` (`_isProductPageCached()`, which honours a merchant's `options.isProductPage` and in the extension is `content.js`'s stricter detector) and handed to the filter. A filter that scopes a retailer to its PDPs reads it; it must not re-derive it. A second copy of the JSON-LD walk inside a site file would drift from the one the rest of the widget acts on, with no owner. It is `undefined` only if that wiring breaks — see the Guess section.

Optional, feature-detected by the bridge:

| Member | Returns | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `canonicalImageUrl(url)` | string | rewrite the URL actually delivered to the fitting room |
| `applyPageFixes()` | void | one-off CSS for that retailer's layout |

At most one filter applies on any host. A filter that throws fails **open** — refusing every image because one regex blew up is a silently dead extension on that retailer, strictly worse than an unfiltered one.

---

## Two different questions

The two filters look alike and are not asking the same thing.

**`revolve.js` asks the shopper's question:** *can this garment be tried on?* Dresses and tops yes; jeans, shoes, bags no. The category is encoded in the style code (`1STR-WD248_V1.jpg` → `D`), read from the asset filename, the card's `/dp/CODE/` link, or the page URL.

**`ugg.js` asks the merchant's question:** *does this try-on sell UGG's product?* UGG is a shoe company and the torso try-on cannot render a boot, so **the entire core catalogue is blocked** and the apparel line is what remains. Read the `FOOTWEAR` set as policy, not as a bug.

Both fail closed on an unrecognised category. Neither can enumerate what the retailer adds next, and "unknown" must never mean "probably fine".

---

## UGG: ordering is load-bearing

The category is the **first path segment** of every product link — nothing else carries it. Image URLs are opaque SKUs, alt text is marketing copy, there is no JSON-LD.

```
/women-boots/classic-ultra-mini/1116109.html
 ────┬─────  ──────┬──────────  ───┬───
category      product slug        SKU
```

`verdict()` runs its branches in an order that was established by live misclassifications. Both of these are one reorder away from returning:

1. **Item-name block runs first, against the whole path.** Socks, gloves, mittens and scarves are merchandised under plain apparel segments. `/women-apparel/braylee-uggisle-scarf/106212.html` is allowed by the apparel branch if this does not run first.
2. **Apparel matches before footwear tokenisation.** A segment like `women-apparel-boot-cut-pants` contains the token `boot` and tokenises as footwear if step 4 runs first.

The same item-name regex is also tested against the tile's `alt`/`title`, which carries the product name on UGG ("Kyro Cozy Crew Sock"). That keeps socks blocked where the wrapping link is absent, absolute, or non-canonical — DOM shapes a path-only check misses.

`check.mjs` §13 pins both ordering rules as fixtures.

### PDP galleries

On a supported PDP the button belongs on the on-model views, not the fabric close-ups. UGG's studio pattern is that close-ups come **last** — verified across 13 apparel PDPs, 11 of which follow it. The two that do not are pinned by SKU in `MEASURED_VIEW_EXCEPTIONS`.

These are measured values from looking at every view of those two galleries, not a rule. **A third exception means re-checking the assumption, not adding a third entry.**

When the gallery cannot be measured (no DOM), position falls back to allowing. Position is a refinement; it must never be the thing that grants or denies a button on its own.

---

## `canonicalImageUrl` — a mutation, deliberately separate

UGG's PLP tiles swap to the `_2` back view on hover, and the swapped element can win the click-time URL race, so the reference image becomes whichever view the cursor triggered. `ugg.js` forces the view digit to `1`.

**Why not the existing hover machinery.** `widget-core` already has `_hoverSafeImgUrl` and first-img-in-parent (see `drag-flip-on-hover.md`). Those recover the *resting* URL for the element the user hovered, and they run only on the button-click path. `canonicalImageUrl` runs in `sendReferenceImage()`, the funnel every delivery path passes through — including PDP auto-start and SPA navigation, which have no hovered element to correct.

**It must run first.** `sendReferenceImage()` derives `_referenceImageUrl`, the prefetched image hash, and the `_tryonContext` attribution record from the URL. Rewriting afterwards leaves the hash and the recorded try-on pointing at a different view than the session actually runs on. `check.mjs` §11 asserts the ordering, not just the presence.

**Known consequence, accepted.** On a PDP this also rewrites a gallery view the shopper deliberately clicked. `isSupportedGarment()` decides where the *button* appears across gallery views; `canonicalImageUrl` decides what is *delivered*, and it is always view 1. So `MEASURED_VIEW_EXCEPTIONS` controls button placement only. If that ever needs to change, it is one line in `ugg.js`.

**Open question, not yet answered:** nobody has checked whether ugg.com's cards are the two-stacked-img pattern or the JS src-swap pattern, or whether the resting front image is always `_1`. If it is, the two mechanisms agree on the hover path and this rewrite earns its place only on the element-less paths. Worth 10 minutes on a live PLP before anyone extends either mechanism.

---

## Guess: a page filter, not a catalogue filter

`guess.js` is the third question the contract can answer, and it is not about the catalogue at all.

**`guess.js` asks: *is the shopper on a product page?*** On guess.com the try-on is offered on PDPs and nowhere else — no buttons on category grids, search, the homepage or editorial, and no floating pill anywhere on the site. There is no garment taxonomy in the file.

### Both halves of that land on machinery that already existed

This is why there is no guess.com branch anywhere in `widget-core.js`:

1. **PDP-only buttons.** The contract is already a per-image veto, and "not a product page" is a perfectly good reason to veto. Returning false everywhere but the PDP *is* the feature.
2. **No pill.** Free. `widget-core` already suppresses the floating pill on any site that has a filter (`_filterOwnsEntry`), on the reasoning that a pill which opens the widget anywhere would ignore the judgement the filter just made. Registering the file is the whole implementation.

Consequence worth stating plainly: on guess.com a shopper on the homepage has **no** way to open the widget. That is the ask, and it is the same single-entry-point doctrine `_filterOwnsEntry` was written for.

### It does not detect the PDP itself

The verdict arrives as `ctx.isProductPage`. This is the one real design decision in the file: the widget already has a product-page detector, it is the one the rest of the widget acts on, and a second copy here would be a slow divergence with no owner. Reusing it inherits the extension's stricter detector, a merchant's override, the 2 s cache, and the re-check after SPA navigation.

`check.mjs` §13b therefore pins **two** things: that `guess.js` returns the right verdict, and that `widget-core.js` still passes `isProductPage: _isProductPageCached()` into `rejects()`. Without the second, `guess.js` sees `undefined` and guess.com quietly returns to site-wide buttons — nothing throws and no other check notices.

### It fails OPEN, unlike its siblings

`revolve.js` and `ugg.js` fail closed on an unrecognised category, because theirs is a *product* judgement and "unknown" must never mean "probably fine".

An absent `ctx.isProductPage` is a different kind of unknown — missing wiring, not an unreadable product — so `guess.js` follows the bridge's infrastructure doctrine instead and fails open. An unfiltered guess.com costs PDP scoping until the wiring is fixed; a fail-closed guess.com would have zero Try-On buttons anywhere. The first is recoverable, the second is a dead extension on the site.

### Measured on live guess.com, 2026-09-18

guess.com is Salesforce Commerce Cloud and **server-renders** its JSON-LD, so the detector's one known weakness — SPAs injecting JSON-LD after `document_idle` — does not apply.

| Page | JSON-LD | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `/en-us/guess/women/clothing/tops/cutout-top-white/W6GP52K5120-G011.html` | `@type:Product`, `offers.@type:Offer`, `sku`+`mpn` | **true** |
| `/en-us/guess-jeans/denim/women/.../W4YN56D5CC3-M3DW.html` | same shape (second brand path) | **true** |
| `/en-us/guess/women/clothing/tops` | `ItemList` + `BreadcrumbList` | false |
| `/en-us/guess/women/clothing/dresses-and-jumpsuits` | `ItemList` | false |
| `/en-us/guess/women` (home) | no `Product` node | false |
| `/en-us/search?q=dress` | no `Product` node | false |

The `offers.@type:"Offer"` shape matters: `content.js`'s detector — the one the extension actually uses — rejects a top-level `@type:"Product"` that carries an `AggregateOffer` with no SKU, to catch catalogue pages masquerading as products. Guess passes on the definitive single-product signal, so both detectors agree.

**There is deliberately no URL regex.** The PDP path shape (`/…/<slug>/<STYLE>-<COLOUR>.html`) is consistent, but the site also serves plain content pages ending in `.html` (`privacy-policy.html`, `faq-landing.html`), so a path rule would need a SKU pattern to stay honest — and would still be a second detector.

### Why it was inert when it first landed, and what fixed it

`guess.js` shipped correct and did nothing, because Guess renders its gallery as a `<product-gallery>` Web Component: the five product images live in its **shadow root**, invisible to `document.querySelectorAll('img')`, and the only product image in the light DOM is a hidden 0×0 preload stub. The PDP gating was right; it was gating a page whose images the scanner could not see. Because this filter also suppresses the pill, that left guess.com with no entry point at all.

That turned out not to be a Guess problem — the scanner had no shadow-DOM traversal anywhere, so every Web Component retailer was silently getting nothing. Fixed generally in `_allImgs()` and friends.

→ `docs/shadow-dom-image-scanning.md`

### "Product page only" is two conditions, and it is reusable

A PDP renders far more than its own product, so the policy needs both halves:

| Condition | ctx field | Answered by |
|---|---|---|
| the page is a PDP | `isProductPage` | the JSON-LD product-page detector |
| the image is *that product's* own image | `isPrimaryProductImage` | the first two of the hero size group |

The second exists because the generic default is deliberately the opposite. The note above `_PDP_BUTTON_MAX_GALLERY_VIEWS` says related-product tiles "keep their button exactly as before" — right for most retailers, since a recommendation tile is a real garment someone may want to try. `guess.js` opts guess.com out of that default; nothing changes for anyone else.

**Neither fact is computed in `guess.js`.** It contains no guess.com URL shapes, CDN paths, SKU parsing or DOM selectors, and `check.mjs` §13b fails the build if any appear in its code.

`isPrimaryProductImage` is not a new heuristic either — it is the one the widget already trusts to place gallery buttons. `_heroSizeGroup()` finds the product's views (the hero `findProductImage()` picks, plus everything rendered at the hero's size), and `_primaryProductImages()` returns the **first two in document order** — the exact set `_isExtraGalleryView()` already lets through. So the filter and the gallery rule agree by construction instead of by two rules being kept in sync.

### Why the simplest version is also the robust one

A rail rendered at the hero's exact size *would* join the size group — plausible on a narrow viewport where a rail goes full-width. Taking the first two **in document order** already absorbs that: a gallery precedes its recommendations, so the first two members are gallery views even when foreign tiles are in the group.

A containment pass (climb to the smallest ancestor holding two members, crossing shadow boundaries) was built here and then removed. Measured against a fixture of five adversarial layouts, it bought exactly one synthetic case over the simple rule and cost a second mechanism to keep correct:

| Fixture layout | first-two rule | + containment |
|---|---|---|
| gallery, then smaller rail | ✅ | ✅ |
| gallery, then **same-size** rail | ✅ | ✅ |
| gallery and rail both in **shadow DOM**, same size | ✅ | ✅ |
| **single-image** PDP + same-size rail | 1 stray button | ✅ |
| rail **above** gallery, same size | ✗ | ✗ |

The last row is not a containment problem — there `findProductImage()` picks a rail tile as the hero because it is higher in the viewport, so the product is already misidentified upstream and every other PDP feature is wrong too. Neither version helps, which is the clearest sign the extra mechanism was not paying for itself.

That is what makes the policy portable. **The whole of it is:**

```js
return ctx.isProductPage === true && ctx.isPrimaryProductImage !== false;
```

The next retailer that asks for "product page only" is a new file with those two lines, a host test and its telemetry. Nothing new in `widget-core.js`, and no knowledge of that retailer's markup.

### Which product vs. how many views — two different owners

`guess.js` says **which product**. It does not say how many views of it get a button: `_isExtraGalleryView()` already trims any gallery to its first two views for every retailer, because whichever view you click builds the same reference pair.

Measured on a live guess.com PDP (every `<img>` ≥120×120, shadow roots included):

| | count | size | outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| the product's own gallery | 5 | 632×948 | admitted here → **2 buttons** after the generic first-two rule |
| "more items" carousels | 30 | 195×292 | refused — 30 other products |
| footer art | 3 | 328×164 | refused (also blocked upstream by the site-chrome rule) |

The split is the point: *which product* is a per-retailer policy and lives in the filter; *how many views of one product* is a generic PDP question already answered once for everyone. Re-deciding it in a site file is the drift these files exist to prevent.

### What it deliberately does not do

It does not judge the image. Every image on a Guess PDP is left to the generic rules, exactly as on the rest of the web. If PDP furniture (the footer lifestyle strip, menu imagery) ever earns a button, the discriminator is already known and belongs in `guess.js`: product shots are `img.guess.com/image/upload/…/<REGION>/Style/ECOMM/<STYLE>-<COLOUR>`, all non-product art is `…/<REGION>/Asset/…`. One line, the day it is needed — and `check.mjs` §13b will ask for a fixture if `canonicalImageUrl` ever appears on the module.

---

## Both contexts: extension *and* web install

These files were originally extension-only, on the reasoning that "a merchant's own store is never revolve.com or ugg.com". That was wrong, and it failed in the worst direction: a retailer with a filter is exactly the retailer most likely to install the widget on its own storefront, and an extension-only filter means Try-On buttons on every boot on ugg.com — the one place the filter matters most.

So all three ship to the web build (`WIDGET_JS_FILES` + `LINT_FILES`), and the launchers fetch them **conditionally**:

```js
var GARMENT_FILTER_HOSTS = /(^|\.)(revolve|ugg|guess)\.com$/i;
```

- ordinary merchant → regex misses → **zero extra requests, zero latency**
- revolve.com / ugg.com / guess.com web install → all filter files fetched in **parallel**, then `widget-core.js`

The three load in parallel because `per_website_garment_filter.js` reads the retailer globals lazily inside its functions — there is no load-order dependency between them, only the requirement that all land before a button is placed.

`onerror` settles the counter exactly like `onload`. A filter that 404s must not stop `widget-core.js` from loading, or we would trade "buttons on boots" for "no widget at all".

All three files are fetched on any filtered host, not just the matching one — the launcher only needs to know *whether* a host has a filter, not which. That trades ~2KB for keeping one regex instead of a host→file map in three launchers.

### The regex is a duplicated fact, and it is checked

`GARMENT_FILTER_HOSTS` is the web half of something the filter files own themselves via `applies()`. If they disagree — a filter claiming a host the launcher regex misses — that filter works perfectly in the Chrome extension and silently never loads on web. Silent in exactly one direction.

`check.mjs` §11 runs each filter's real `applies()` against its canonical host and asserts every launcher regex matches it. Adding a site file without a `SITE_HOSTS` entry fails the check rather than skipping the assertion.

### The guard still cannot be dropped

Shipping to the web does **not** make the global unconditional — the launchers fetch these only on filtered hosts, so on every other storefront `DecartGarmentFilter` genuinely does not exist. `widget-core.js` is shared verbatim with the web build, so an unguarded reference is a `ReferenceError` on every Shopify store, thrown from inside the predicate that decides where Try-On buttons go, i.e. **no buttons anywhere**.

### The performance early-out is not cosmetic

`_garmentFilterRejects()` checks `hasCustomFilter()` before resolving the image URL. Without it, the `_extractImageUrlFromEl` lazy-loader walk runs for every image on every site in the extension, to build a URL the dispatcher immediately discards. The old per-retailer guard got this early-out free from `DecartRevolve.applies()`; the bridge has to ask for it explicitly.

---

## Where the veto sits, and why

`_isTryOnableImage()` calls the veto **above every `return true`**. It was originally written below the shared-tile-size check, which returns true early — and on a category grid every tile shares its rendered size, so the whitelist was bypassed on exactly the pages it exists for. Silent in both directions: nothing errors, buttons just appear on jeans again. `check.mjs` §11 pins the position.

The filter is subtractive only: it can hide a button, never add one. The generic layer remains the sole judge of what counts as a product image, so a retailer's banner showing a dress still loses its button to the geometry rules rather than winning one from the whitelist.

`findTryOnableProductImage()` is a wrapper over `findProductImage()` rather than a change to it, because `findProductImage()` also feeds add-to-cart attribution — which must keep reporting the real product even on a page whose garment we do not offer. Filtering it there would quietly put holes in the attribution data.

---

## Adding another retailer

1. Write `<site>.js` exposing `applies()` and `isSupportedGarment(ctx)`. No `chrome.*`.
2. Register it in `_registered()` in `per_website_garment_filter.js`.
3. Add it to `content_scripts` in `manifest.json`, before `widget-core.js`.
4. Add it to `SITE_FILES` / `SITE_GLOBALS` / `SITE_HOSTS` in `check.mjs` §11.
5. Add a fixture table alongside §12/§13/§13b, and host cases to §14 (including its `files` array — a filter missing from that array is never loaded by the integration test, so every case still passes).
6. Add it to `WIDGET_JS_FILES` **and** `LINT_FILES` in `release.sh`, and widen `GARMENT_FILTER_HOSTS` **and** `GARMENT_FILTER_FILES` in the `anywear*.js` launchers.

**Watch the duplicated trees in step 6 — six files, not three, and two `release.sh`:**

| What | Copies |
|---|---|
| `release.sh` | project root **and** `chrome_extension/release.sh` — identical but for how they resolve `ROOT`, both live entry points |
| `anywear*.js` | `shoppify/public/` **and** `backend/shopify/public/` — currently byte-identical |

`release.sh` ships launchers from `backend/shopify/public`, while `check.mjs` §11 reads `shoppify/public`. Update only one and you get the worst outcome available: the check passes against a copy that is not the one being shipped.

Steps 4–6 are what `check.mjs` §11 exists to force: skip any of them and the filter works in the extension while doing nothing on a web install of the same store.

---

## Telemetry

Every filter reports once per reason per page — `revolve_garment_filtered`, `ugg_garment_filtered`, `guess_garment_filtered` — so systematic over-blocking shows up as data rather than as a guess. UGG's `unknown → block` default is aggressive; without this, over-blocking is invisible. If one fires broadly, the retailer changed something.

On Guess the reasons are diagnostic rather than a policy readout: `not_product_page` is the ordinary case and should dominate, while **`pdp_verdict_missing` should never appear in a shipped build** — it means `widget-core` stopped passing the verdict and PDP scoping is silently off. `check.mjs` §13b pins that wiring, so an event of that kind in production means something shipped around the check.
